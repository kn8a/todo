## Objectives:
- make a todo app that is suitable for daily use
- use cards as tasks to make it more effective as a simple tool for notes.

## Bugs to fix:
- prevent duplicate project names.
- make sidebar sticky.
- deletion of last project sometimes causes an error.
- remove associated tasks from DOM when project is deleted.

## Featured to add:
- date-fns.
- toggle view (cards/list).
- undo completed task.
- display number of incomplete tasks for each project item.
- add project name above cards.
- place code on index.js into modules.

## Learned: 
- searching array by object property.
- saving/retrieving data to/from localstorage.
- additional practice working with modules & object constructors.
- practice different DOM manipulation techniques.
- working with node value property.
- practice proper order of code.
- importance of planning data structure and functions in advance.
- different methods of removing DOM elements

## Mistakes:
- Workikng on the project before fully planning it.
- Approaching parts of the project in an incorrect order, resulted in code being more complex than it could have been otherwise.
- Code ended up being complex and resulted in having to add many patches on the surface rather than fixing the bugs in their source.
- Array of task objects is seperate from 'projects array' instead should have done an array of projects objects with tasks array nested in an object.
